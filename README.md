# Wilderfeast
A website made for a better organization of RPG data! It's a project me and a few friends are making, I'm responsible for the front-end code
# How to install
```
git clone https://github.com/MoisesLN/Wilderfeast.git
cd Wilderfeast
python -m http.server
```
After that, just acess [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) on your browser! This runs a local server (similar to VS Code's extension Live Server).
